## Development Setup

**Prerequisites**

- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) Meerkat or newer
- JDK 11 or newer (bundled with Android Studio)
- Android SDK with API 24 (minimum) and API 36 (target) installed

**Getting started**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maximilian-schwaerzler/Do-It.git
```

Open the cloned directory in Android Studio. Gradle will sync automatically.

---

## Build Commands

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug          # Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleRelease        # Build release APK
./gradlew test                   # Run JVM unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest   # Run instrumented tests (requires device/emulator)
./gradlew lint                   # Run lint checks
./gradlew check                  # Run all checks (lint + tests)
```

To run a single test class:

```bash
./gradlew test --tests "com.anzhuo.todo.ExampleUnitTest"
```

---

## Code Style

- Follow the [official Kotlin style guide](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html) (
  `kotlin.code.style=official` is set in `gradle.properties`).
- Follow [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/) guidelines; use MD3 components wherever
  possible.
- Keep the MVVM + unidirectional data flow architecture. ViewModels expose state via `StateFlow`/
  `Flow`; composables collect with `collectAsStateWithLifecycle`.
- Prefer the existing `ViewModelProvider.Factory` companion pattern over Hilt. Only introduce Hilt
  if the dependency graph becomes complex enough to justify it.
- Add all new dependencies to `gradle/libs.versions.toml` first, then reference them in
  `app/build.gradle.kts` via the version catalog alias.

## Commit Message Convention

Use semantic commit prefixes so the history stays easy to scan:

| Prefix      | When to use                                       |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `feat:`     | New user-facing feature                           |
| `fix:`      | Bug fix                                           |
| `ui:`       | Visual / layout change                            |
| `i18n:`     | Translation or localization work                  |
| `anim:`     | Animation or motion change                        |
| `refactor:` | Internal restructure with no behavior change      |
| `style:`    | Code formatting or drawable/style resource change |
| `docs:`     | Documentation only                                |
| `chore:`    | Build scripts, dependencies, tooling              |

Add a scope in parentheses when it helps (`feat(settings):`, `fix(room):`). Reference related issues
at the end of the subject line where applicable (`fixes #42`).

## Translations

The app is localized using Android string resources under `app/src/main/res/`. Translations are
managed on [Weblate](https://weblate.mschwaerzler.com/engage/do-it/).

**Contribute or update a translation** — sign up on Weblate and suggest or improve strings directly
in your browser. Weblate automatically opens a pull request with your changes once they are
approved.

**Request a new language** — open an issue using
the [Language Request](https://github.com/maximilian-schwaerzler/Do-It/issues/new?template=language_request.yml)
template, or request the language directly on Weblate.
